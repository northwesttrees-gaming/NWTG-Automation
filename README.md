### RIT BLOCKS / AUTO FARMING MACHINES
The Minecraft modification is designed to make things more automated using advanced logic and a mix of procedures and commands and basic game know how to make doing tasks such as crafting, farming collecting and so on all automated. It is possible to transport items to dedicated locations without long pipe lines with the RIT (Remote Item Teleporter) block. Automated Farming has never been better with Auto detection of mature crops harvesting and replanting mechanics with support for RIT blocks.
    
### AUTO CRAFTING / AUTO CRAFTING REQUESTS
Auto Crafting is a long term project that will take time to add recipes for this reason if you have a specific recipe in Vanilla Minecraft you want to be added in a future update we advise you to open a request on our GitHub repository under Issues > Custom Crafting Request. This will let us know there is a higher demand for a specific recipe.
